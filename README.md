# Project_Local_Library_1

This site is made to help with functionality regarding library books. The site helps navigate borrowers of books, checked out status, popularity and more.

The site could be updated to be used with most transaction/sales services. In which case, new componenets and ideas my need to be implemented to make the site work as intended. Overall, though this site is pretty versatile in how it could be used.

In the future I hope to update this code to be used with other services to see how well it would translate to other sales or item related inquires.
